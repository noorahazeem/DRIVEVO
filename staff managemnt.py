3.3 FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
The feasibility study concern with the considerations made to verify whether the system fit to be developed in
all terms. Feasibility analysis is the test of the system proposal made to identify whether the user needs may
be satisfied using the current software and hardware technologies, whether the system will be cost effective
from a business point of view and whether it can be developed with the given budgetary constraints. When a
new project is proposed, it normally goes through feasibility assessment. Feasibility study is carried out to
determine whether the proposed system is possible to develop with available resources and what should be the
cost consideration.
The feasibility study to be conducted for this project involves:
 Technical Feasibility
 Operational Feasibility
 Economic Feasibility
 Behavioral Feasibility
3.3.1 Technical Feasibility
The system must be evaluated from the technical viewpoint first. The assessment of this feasibility must be
based on an outline design of the system requirement in terms of input, output, programs, procedure and staff.
Having identified the outline of the system, the investigation must go on to suggest the type of equipment,
required method of developing the system, and the method of running the system. DRIVEVO is developed by 
9
using front end as PYTHON, DJANGO and back end as MYSQL. It is technically feasible and has lots of
features.
3.3.2 Operational Feasibility
DRIVEVO is mainly related to human organizational. This test of feasibility asks if the system will work when
it is developed and installed. It also measures how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes
advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements
identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.There is no difficulty in implementing
this system. The DRIVEVO is effective and user friendly. To ensure success, desired operational outcomes
must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters such as
reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others.
3.3.3 Economic Feasibility
In the economic feasibility the development cost of the system is evaluated weighting it against the ultimate
benefit derived from the new system. Benefits can be tangible and intangible, direct or indirect. As assessment
of the economic justification for a computer based system project is cost benefit. Cost benefit analysis is
complicated by criteria that vary with the characteristics of the system to be developed, the relative size of the
project and the respected return on investment derived as part of the strategic plan. DRIVEVO is economically
feasible because IDE used for developing the software is free of cost.
