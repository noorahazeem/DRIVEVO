3.3.4 Behavioral Feasibility
The behavioral feasibility depends upon whether the system performed in the expected way or not. Behavioral
Feasibility study is a test of system proposal according to it workability, impact on organization, ability to
meet userâ€™s need and effective use of resources. However, a feasibility study provides a useful starting point
for full analysis. The state-transition diagram represents the behavior of a system by depicting its status and
the events that use the system to change state. DRIVEVO is behaviorally feasible because of the effective use
of the resources and also the system satisfies user needs and is user friendly.
