Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to
be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has
fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially
when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning
Python:
 Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile
your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
 Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly
to write your programs.
 Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that
encapsulates code within objects.
 Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and
supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW
browsers to games.
Characteristics of python:
 It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
 It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
 It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
 It supports automatic garbage collection.
 It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
4.3.2 Django
Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications. It is
also called batteries included framework because Django provides built-in features for everything including
Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. When you’re building a website, you always need
a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a
management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made
components to use and that too for rapid development.
