DRIVEVO is unique automotive dealership management software designed to serve the daily operational
requirements of a dealership. It is a flexible and tailor-made integrated software solution developing in latest
version of python and Django for automotive dealerships and their operations. It covers complete sales cycle
from advance booking to sales invoice generation. Data inside the software is secure and accessible based on
a highly scalable permissions hierarchy.
In this project, DRIVEVO, separately developing the dealership management software which is based on the
requirements from the dealership peoples that is pre-owned car dealers. By differentiating the sales, service
and spares details. As well the business improvements also could been evaluated by adding up the accounts
modules which gives the full details of accounts maintenance. A web-based dealership management software
was used to track the main dealer and sub-dealers. Here, the technology is used Python along with the
application of blockchain, it can reduce the cost and increased efficiency, reduction in errors and design
changes, better record keeping and compliance, open source, time consuming, and it is secured. The scope of
this technique is to supply user economical operating surroundings and additional output will be generated
through this. This technique provides user-friendly interface leading to knowing each and every usability
options of the system. This technique helps in chase records so past records will be verified through them and
one will build choices supported the past records. This technique completes a really less time, leading to less
time consumption and high level of potency. DRIVEVO is developed in such how that even a naive user can
even operate the system simply. The calculations are made very quickly, and the records are directly saved
into databases and the databases can be maintained for a longer period of time since blockchain technology is
used. Each record can be retrieved and can be verified for the future transactions. The Blockchain technology
records the transactions to a digital lender where it is not possible to alter. They are linked with the help of
cryptography. Furthermore, this system provides a high level of security for data leaking as only admin people
can access the database and no changes can be made in it until it verifies the user login id and password.
Information can be verified easily. Data is decentralized and is shared with all the computers in the network
and thereby chances of data loss did not exist. We also have sales manager and reception login through which
both of them can deal with customers and other specified operations and cannot make changes in the dat
